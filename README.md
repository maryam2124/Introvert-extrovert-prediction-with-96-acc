This project uses supervised machine learning to predict personality types — Introvert or Extrovert — based on behavioral and psychological traits.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal is to develop a model that can classify whether an individual is an introvert or extrovert using data-driven methods. The dataset includes survey-based features representing personal preferences, social behavior, and energy orientation.

## 🔍 Dataset Description

- **Features**: Behavioral traits (e.g., sociability, talkativeness, preference for solitude, etc.)
- **Target**: Personality label - `Introvert` or `Extrovert`
- **Format**: CSV or structured tabular form

## 🛠️ Workflow

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Encoding categorical variables
3. Scaling numerical features
4. Training classification model
5. Generating predictions

## 🧠 ML Techniques Used

- Logistic Regression (primary classifier)
- Scikit-learn pipelines
- Feature encoding (OneHot, LabelEncoding)
- Standardization

## 📁 Files Included

- `Introvert Extrovert Prediction.ipynb` – Complete notebook with data processing and model training
- `README.md` – Project documentation
- Dataset CSV file – (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e7) kaggle competition dataset

## 📌 Key Highlights

- Simple and interpretable machine learning pipeline
- Clean preprocessing and transformation
- Focus on personality prediction using real-world psychological concepts

## 💡 Motivation

Understanding personality types helps in better communication, team building, and psychological profiling. This project aims to use AI for meaningful insights into human behavior.
